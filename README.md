# Dev Landing Page

Minimal landing page for developers.

Developers don't talk much. Their code does all the talking. So here's a minimal landing page for developers.

## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

I wanted a dev landing page to showcase everything I do online and I wanted it to be minimal and right to the point rather beautiful and hefty. And I think most of the devs out there would want the same.

So I sat down one night and created this **Dev Landing Page**. Feel free to fork, clone, play around and make this your own.

## Themes

Dev Landing Page comes in 9 **material themes**.
